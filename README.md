## What is this?

Examples and notes accumulated while reading "[Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com)" by Miran Lipovaƒça. My nth attempt at learning the Haskell programming language.

I'm also just going to put random bits of programs I'm writing here if I find them useful.
